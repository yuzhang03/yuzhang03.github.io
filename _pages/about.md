I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Bastian Solutions, a Toyota Advanced Logistics company](https://www.bastiansolutions.com/). I obtained my PhD in [Computer Science](https://www.engr.uky.edu/research-faculty/departments/computer-science/) at the [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](https://jacobsn.github.io/) in March 2023. My research focuses on deep learning and computer vision, specifically on domain adaptation and multi-modal data modeling.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [Northeastern University](https://neu.edu.cn/), China in June 2017.

I enjoy hiking and music.
