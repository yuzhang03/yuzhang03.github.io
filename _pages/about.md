I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.engr.uky.edu/research-faculty/departments/computer-science/) at the [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/). My research focuses on deep learning and computer vision, specifically on domain adaptation and multi-modal data analysis.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [Northeastern University](http://english.neu.edu.cn/), China in June 2017.

I enjoy hiking and music.
